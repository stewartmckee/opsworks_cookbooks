Description
===========

Chef cookbook for ffmpeg installation.

Note: At the moment it just installs ffmpeg as is without extra configuration,
if you need some other functionality, feel free to submit pull requests.

Currently the cookbook supports only source install using ark,
which should be cross platform.
